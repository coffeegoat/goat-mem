Goat Memorization Software:

My first commit, not quite sure how this works, but here goes

I made changes in every file, adjusted the templates a little here and there, and added romans chapters 1-4 to the data base

Finally, I may have made perl cry but to get the formatting to work correctly I added some Latex commands into the variable declarations for the week days.  This allows me to manually set the height of each day without modifying any other chunk of code.
